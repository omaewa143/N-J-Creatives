                        <li><span>Business Background </span><br> In May 2024, a group of first-year college students embarked on a journey unlike 
                            any other—the launch of N&J Creative Crafts. With little experience in entrepreneurship but a wealth of enthusiasm and 
                            passion for creativity, we dove headfirst into the world of handmade treasures.
                            The beginnings were humble yet filled with excitement and anticipation. From brainstorming ideas to setting up our
                            workspace, every step felt like a new adventure. We encountered challenges along the way, from sourcing materials
                            to defining our brand identity, but each obstacle was met with determination and a willingness to learn.
                            As we delved deeper into the world of handicrafts, we discovered the joy of creation and the satisfaction of seeing our 
                            ideas come to life. </li>

                            eagerly anticipating our transition to 1st year college in the upcoming 2024 school year. 
                            Bursting with excitement and fueled by our passion for innovation, we are laying the groundwork for our future endeavors. 
                            With a shared commitment to excellence and a thirst for knowledge, we look forward to embracing new challenges, expanding our horizons,
